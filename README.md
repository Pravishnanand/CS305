Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client for both projects was Artemis Financial, and the primary issue they wanted us to address was the enhancement of software security. In Project 1, the focus was on analyzing and improving the security of their database management software to protect sensitive student records and financial data. In Project 2, the goal was to secure their e-commerce website's search functionality and protect sensitive financial information, ensuring that customer data remains confidential.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

One aspect where I excelled in addressing the client's software security vulnerabilities was in conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment. I systematically reviewed the code, identified potential security weaknesses, and provided detailed recommendations for mitigation. This approach was crucial because it allowed me to proactively address security risks and strengthen the software's defenses. It is essential to code securely because insecure software can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and damage to a company's reputation. Software security adds significant value to a company's overall well-being by protecting sensitive data, maintaining user trust, ensuring compliance with regulations, and safeguarding the company's reputation.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging but helpful part of the vulnerability assessment was identifying vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies. We used tools like OWASP Dependency-Check Maven to scan for vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies. This was challenging because these vulnerabilities were not introduced by our code but could still pose a security risk. Addressing these vulnerabilities required careful evaluation, updating dependencies, and ensuring that the software remained secure despite external factors.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increase layers of security, I implemented several measures. I recommendeded the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for data encryption and secure hash functions like SHA-256 for data integrity checks. Additionally, I configured the software to use HTTPS for secure communication and employed SSL certificates for encryption. In the future, I would continue to assess vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check Maven and regularly update dependencies to mitigate security risks. I would also conduct code reviews and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To ensure the code and software application were functional and secure, I performed functional testing to verify that the code changes had not introduced new vulnerabilities. I also conducted thorough testing of the encryption and secure communication features to confirm their effectiveness. After refactoring the code, I conducted security testing and reviewed the vulnerability assessment to ensure that the changes had not introduced new vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

In this project, I used industry-standard best practices for secure coding, such as employing cryptographic techniques, implementing HTTPS for secure communication, and conducting vulnerability assessments. These practices are valuable for future assignments or tasks as they establish a strong foundation for developing secure software. They also demonstrate a commitment to security and compliance with industry standards, which can be showcased to future employers as evidence of expertise in secure software development.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, I would present a comprehensive vulnerability assessment report and a mitigation plan, demonstrating my ability to identify and address security vulnerabilities effectively. These artifacts showcase my analytical skills, attention to detail, and commitment to secure software development practices. Additionally, I would provide code samples highlighting the implementation of security features such as cryptographic hashing and secure communication protocols, reinforcing my capability to write secure and robust code. Overall, this assignment serves as tangible evidence of my skills, knowledge, and experience in software security and would be valuable to present to future employers as a testament to my proficiency in this critical domain.
